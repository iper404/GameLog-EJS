<h2>About this Project</h2>
<p align="left">Game Log is a web app which allows the user to track the video games that they are currently playing. The user can search for games, add games to their list, and input the current amount of hours they put into playing the game. The game length in hours will be stored as a characteristic of each game, and the user will be able to track how many hours they have left to beat a game they are currently playing. The user will be able to view all games, in-progress games, and completed games. There are many more features that will be added in the future, including sorting & user registration.
